==========

An adaptive grid framework using HTML5, CSS3 &amp; some JS that is optimized for the web and its frameworks.

Concept:
A good grid system using html5, css3 and some good JS (probably jQuery) to give a consitent working environment to web application developers in all frameworks.
See, part two to this is once a base layout is setup, we'll have a Ruby rake task or Rails template that takes this base framework and insert it all into all the asset folders in rails.  Python may have something similar. Php might. who knows.  Point is this will exist, and someone will write the wrapper for your framework to put all the crap where it needs to be put.

No one writes in pure HTML and JS and CSS only.

We want to speed up a good adaptive grid framework into your web framework of choice.

We may take some liberties in choosing fonts; colours; links; as a base so it doesn't look so ugly.

Whenever possible HTML 5 with the widest support will be implemented. I fear some flash may creep in, like in github's cut and paste button.

Anyways, that is the plan.

CSSGrid.net is going to be the grid system's starting point. Normalize for css reset.
headjs.com for loading of the js
CDN links to jquery.latest; jquery.ui.latest (or something else... not sure yet)

Documentation
------------
We'll be using this wiki on github to tell you how to use it to build your pages in your framework, so even you design illiterate developers can make decent looking sites out of the box that don't look like twitter bootstrap.

take out index.html for a spin during our initial setup.  It's normalize.com's test.html page, just in cssgrid's 1140 grid.
